# HediDar.github.io
this is a simple to do project

in this project, we can add multiple todo's lists, mark them as done, and finally, delete them.

We can display and filter the tasks shown by 3 different ways:
1- Show all tasks
2- Show active tasks
3- Show tasks done

all of the data displayd and modified is linked to a mongo db data base, treated with a back end project realised with node js.
